    "# 📖 Recap: Prompt Engineering Framework & Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is Prompting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompting is the act of giving instructions to a generative AI tool so it produces a desired output. The quality of the output depends heavily on how well the input (the prompt) is designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The 5-Step Prompting Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "A reliable formula for crafting effective prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task** → Define clearly what you want the AI to do. Include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Persona** (the role/expertise AI should adopt).\n",
    "   * **Format** (how you want the answer presented).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context** → Provide background details, goals, constraints, or audience.\n",
    "   Example: Instead of “gift ideas under \\$30,” add “for a 29-year-old who switched from snowboarding to skiing.”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **References** → Give examples or samples (texts, apps, links) to guide tone, style, or structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluate** → Check the AI’s response: Is it accurate, useful, relevant?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iterate** → Refine your prompt with more detail, rewording, or constraints until you get what you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Mnemonic: **Thoughtfully, Create, Really, Excellent, Inputs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Shot Prompting Explained 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Zero-shot**: No examples, just instructions. Quick but often generic.\n",
    "* **One-shot**: One example given → AI follows style/structure better.\n",
    "* **Few-shot**: 2–5 examples provided → balances guidance with creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Iteration Techniques (ABI = Always Be Iterating)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first output isn’t right:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Revisit the framework** → Add persona, format, more details.\n",
    "2. **Shorten prompts** → Break long tasks into smaller ones.\n",
    "3. **Tweak phrasing / use analogies** → Reframe the request.\n",
    "4. **Add constraints** → Budgets, audience limits, style rules, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Modalities in Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text prompting**: Best with clear persona, format, and context.\n",
    "* **Image prompting**: Needs vivid description of size, colors, elements, style.\n",
    "* **Multimodal prompting**: Combine text with other inputs (images, audio, documents).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: Upload a schedule → ask AI to extract times into a table.\n",
    "  * Example: Upload nail art photo → ask for social media captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Responsible & Ethical Use of AI\n",
    "\n",
    "* Align with goals & policies.\n",
    "* Protect confidential/personal data.\n",
    "* Fact-check outputs → AI can make errors or hallucinate.\n",
    "* Human-in-the-loop → Always verify before using results professionally.\n",
    "* Watch for bias → Use inclusive, stereotype-free language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Handling Hallucinations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hallucinations** = AI outputs that don’t match reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * ✅ Creative use: brainstorming, fiction.\n",
    "  * ❌ Risky in factual tasks: research, analysis.\n",
    "* Strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Fact-check against trusted sources.\n",
    "  2. Cross-reference with built-in verification tools.\n",
    "  3. Collaborate with others for validation.\n",
    "  4. Iterate with clearer, more specific prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Prompt Engineering Quiz (Key Takeaways)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompting** → Giving clear instructions to AI to guide outputs.\n",
    "2. **Primary Task** → “Explain how car batteries work…” (that’s the task).\n",
    "3. **Practical Menus** → Adding **constraints** like calories.\n",
    "4. **Audio → Visual** → That’s **multimodal prompting**.\n",
    "5. **Human-in-the-loop** → Humans verify, fact-check, and ensure outputs are reliable.\n",
    "6. **Refine “Create a dataset”** → Add context, constraints, and format details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Final Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective prompting is all about **clarity, context, and iteration**. Use the framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task → Context → References → Evaluate → Iterate.**\n",
    "And remember: **Always Be Iterating (ABI).**\n"
