    "####  Question 1: What is prompting?\n",
    "  **Answer:**\n",
    "* Prompting is the process of giving instructions or inputs to a generative AI system so it produces the desired output. It involves framing queries clearly to guide the AI’s response effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 2: In the following prompt, which part describes the primary task?\n",
    "Prompt: “Explain how car batteries work using non-technical language that someone without any mechanical knowledge could understand and interpret.”\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "* The primary task is **“Explain how car batteries work”**. The rest of the prompt specifies how the explanation should be delivered (non-technical and easy to understand).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 3: When you are using a gen AI tool to create a healthy three-course menu that requires a certain number of calories, which prompting element will ensure the menu is more practical?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "* Including **constraints or requirements** like calorie count ensures the menu is practical. Constraints help the AI generate output that is realistic and aligned with the user’s needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 4: Prompting with audio to receive a visual representation is called what?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "* This is called **multimodal prompting**. It uses one mode of input (audio) to generate another form of output (visual representation).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 5: What does a human-in-the-loop approach to prompting emphasize?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "* A human-in-the-loop approach emphasizes **continuous human oversight and feedback** to refine AI responses. It ensures accuracy, safety, and alignment with user goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 6: When the initial prompt \"Create a dataset\" is too broad, what should you do to refine it?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "* You should **add details and context** such as the type of dataset, format, size, and purpose. Refining prompts with specifics makes the AI’s output more useful and targeted.\n",
