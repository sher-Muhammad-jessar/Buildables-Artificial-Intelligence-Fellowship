    "\n",
    "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style prompting helps convert complex decisions into transparent, auditable steps: it forces you to define criteria, weigh trade-offs, and produce a defensible recommendation with an execution path. Tree-of-Thought (ToT) style prompting multiplies creativity by generating distinct branches (diverse solution concepts) and evaluating them against different constraints. Combining both gives you wide coverage (many candidate ideas) and deep executionability (clear steps for the winner), which is especially useful in fellowship or startup settings where both novelty and reproducibility matter.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an experienced program manager organizing corporate offsite events. I have a $5,000 budget to run a one-day team retreat for 20 people in a nearby city (no overnight). Produce a prioritized budget allocation with dollar amounts and percentages, a sample half-day or full-day itinerary, step-by-step reasoning for each line item, per-person cost breakdown, three KPIs to measure success (with targets), top risks and mitigations, and a 3-point list of immediate next steps.

    "\n",
    "My goal is to deliver a one-day retreat that strengthens team alignment and produces a few concrete action items, while staying within $5,000.\n",
    "First I list essential spending categories that directly affect outcomes: food (keeps people present and happy), venue (space to meet and run activities), structured activities/facilitation (drives outcomes), AV & materials (enables workshops), transport support (lowers attendance friction), small awards or team-building incentives (boosts engagement), and contingency (for overruns). I prioritize spending so that product (the quality of facilitation + clear outcomes) and participant comfort come first; venue and food get meaningful shares because they affect attendance and energy, and facilitation gets a solid share because the retreat must produce action. I divide the $5,000 across these categories using round, easy-to-communicate percentages to keep per-person math simple for a group of 20. I validate totals sum to $5,000 and compute per-person equivalents so stakeholders can see unit costs.\n",

    "## 4) Sample one-day itinerary (deliverables & timing)\n",

    "10:15–11:30 — Session 1: Strategic alignment workshop (facilitator-led): identify top 3 priorities.\n",

    "14:00–15:00 — Session 3: Consolidate solutions, decide on owners for action items.\n",
    "15:00–15:30 — Recognition, small awards / team reflections.\n",
    "15:30–16:00 — Wrap-up: commitment cards (who does what by when).\n",
    "16:00–16:30 — Optional social debrief or transit assistance.\n",

    "Deliverables: prioritized list of top 3 team objectives, 3 assigned action items with owners and deadlines, short post-retreat survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5) KPIs (what to measure) and targets\n",
    "\n",
    "I’d track three primary KPIs to assess success: attendee satisfaction (post-event survey average >= 4.2/5), action-item completion rate (percentage of assigned items completed within 2 weeks ≥ 70%), and engagement (percent of participants actively contributing during breakout sessions — target ≥ 80% attendance + participation). Tracking these shows whether the retreat produced alignment and follow-through.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6) Key assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "I assume 20 attendees, a local one-day event (no hotels), moderate dietary needs accommodated (vegetarian/vegan/gluten-free), basic AV needs (projector + mic), and a facilitator available for \\$1,000 for a day. If attendee count changes, re-scale per-person costs linearly or renegotiate vendor pricing (venues often have flat vs per-person pricing).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7) Top risks and mitigations\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk: Low attendance or last-minute dropouts. Mitigation: Send calendar invites early, share clear objectives, provide modest transport stipend to reduce barriers, confirm RSVP one week out.\n",
    "Risk: Facilitator unavailable or costs higher than estimated. Mitigation: Have two facilitator options (freelance and internal lead), and know which activities can be led internally if necessary.\n",
    "Risk: Food or AV failure. Mitigation: Confirm vendor logistics 72 hours before; have backup bottled water/coffee and a spare laptop/adapter on-site. Use contingency funds if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8) Quick sensitivity checks / alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "If attendance rises to 25, per-person cost becomes \\$200 ( \\$5,000/25 ) and some line items (venue, food) may need renegotiation; consider switching to a slightly cheaper venue or buffet lunch. If the facilitator costs \\$1,500, reduce awards and material line items (\\$250 each) and consider using part of contingency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9) Immediate next steps (3 items)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finalize date and confirm 20 attendees with RSVP deadline one month prior.\n",
    "2. Book venue and caterer (hold with deposit) and confirm AV needs.\n",
    "3. Engage facilitator and share retreat objectives and draft agenda for alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10) Refined prompt (to get a more constrained AI plan)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an event planner with corporate retreat experience. I have $5,000 and 20 confirmed attendees for a one-day local retreat (9:00–16:30). Produce:\n",

    "2) A minute-by-minute itinerary and facilitator script outline for each session.\n",

    "\n",
    "Prompt chaining breaks a big challenge into smaller, manageable steps. Instead of overwhelming the team with a massive project, you can first **outline the plan (big picture)**, then **expand individual parts (details)**, and finally **create activities or refine with logic (execution)**. This structured approach makes complex projects less intimidating, ensures all aspects are covered, and keeps collaboration smooth—since each person can focus on a clear step. It also fosters creativity (through ToT) and clarity (through CoT), leading to more effective teamwork and better project outcomes.\n"

    "* Productivity decreases for collaborative tasks because of communication barriers and lack of face-to-face interaction.\n",

    "\n",
    "**AI Output (Gaps & Improvements):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Gap:** The report lacks quantitative evidence (surveys, productivity metrics) to support claims.\n",
    "* **Perspective Gap:** Limited discussion on diversity of roles—productivity impacts differ for engineers, managers, and creatives.\n",
    "* **Comparative Gap:** No cross-industry comparison (tech vs. healthcare vs. education).\n",

    "* **Tone:** Currently academic and neutral. For business readers, add practical case studies and real-world success stories.\n",
