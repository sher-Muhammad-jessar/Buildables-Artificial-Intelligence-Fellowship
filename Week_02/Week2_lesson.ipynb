    "\n",
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "* Context memory is important in chatbots because it allows the system to ‚Äúremember‚Äù previous parts of a conversation. Without memory, the chatbot treats every input as an isolated question, leading to unnatural and disconnected interactions. Memory ensures continuity, personalization, and relevance in conversations. For example, if a user asks, ‚ÄúWho is Albert Einstein?‚Äù followed by, ‚ÄúWhen was he born?‚Äù, a chatbot with memory will understand that ‚Äúhe‚Äù refers to Einstein. This makes the user experience smoother and more human-like.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Checking API limits and pricing is equally important for beginners because most AI services charge based on usage (number of requests or tokens processed). If a beginner repeatedly calls the API without optimization, they may quickly run out of free credits or face high charges. Monitoring usage helps manage costs, prevents service interruptions, and teaches beginners to design efficient systems. This awareness is especially critical in real-world applications where scaling can increase costs significantly."
